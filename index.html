                In 2019, I joined the United States Marine Corps as an Infantry Machine Gunner, where I developed a disciplined mindset and love for solving problems. During my service, I was introduced to the world of technology, it was here that I developed a passion for understanding how and why computers worked.
After I was honorably discharge, I pursued a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Mississippi, laying a foundation in computing principles. Recognizing my growing interest in cybersecurity, I transitioned to Western Governors University, where I am currently advancing my expertise by earning a Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance.
