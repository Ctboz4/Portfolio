    <section>
    <header>I created and deployed a static website using Amazon S3, AWS's cloud storage service, to host HTML content and supporting assets. The project involved setting up an S3 bucket, configuring static website hosting, managing file permissions, and troubleshooting access issues.</header>

        <h2>Steps I took</h2>
                    <h3>Set Up the S3 Bucket</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Created an S3 bucket in the Ohio region to store website files.</li>
                        <li>Ensured a globally unique bucket name as required by S3.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Uploaded Files</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Uploaded the main index.html file for website structure.</li>
                            <li>Added a supporting folder with images and other assets for styling and functionality.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <h3>Enabled Static Website Hosting</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Configured the bucket to act as a static website by enabling hosting settings</li>
                        <li>Obtained the bucket's endpoint URL to access the hosted website.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Diagnosed and resolved file access issues by updating permissions and re-uploading corrected files.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                </li>

        <section id="steps">
            <h2>Challenges I faced</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Encountered a "403 Forbidden" error when accessing the website initially due to private file settings. Resolved by adjusting permissions and making the necessary files public</li>
           <li>Learned the importance of organizing and maintaining the correct folder structure for website assets.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>


        <section id="steps">
            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Gained an understanding of how Amazon S3 stores and serves data for website hosting.</li>
                <li>Learned how to configure permissions and troubleshoot common access errors.</li>
                <li>Realized the significance of precise file and folder organization in cloud-based projects.</li>
                <li>Enhanced my ability to identify and resolve technical issues efficiently.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="steps">
            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>The static website was successfully deployed and accessible via the S3 bucket's endpoint URL. This project strengthened my understanding of AWS services and demonstrated my ability to apply cloud-based solutions effectively.</p>
